My shell setup

# Setup

This setup includes:

- brew
  - On OS X `brew`
  - On Linux `homebrew`
- jenv
- nodenv
- personal git aliases
- neovim
  - Vundle
  - Custom .vimrc

# Installation

Run the install script (`./install/run/`). This will install:

- brew
- git
- jenv
- nodenv
- neovim
  - alias vim=nvim

There is also a single script for each of these resources

## brew

With brew now also available on linux it's easy to create a unified install script.
